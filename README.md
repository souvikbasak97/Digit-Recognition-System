# Digit-Recognition-System
Digit recognition system using KMeans algorithm on the popular MNIST handwritten dataset.

In this project I have built and classified handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset using Kmeans clustering algorithm and predicted test labels with an accuracy of 89.59 percentage accuracy using 256 clusters.The kmeans algorithm achieves a maximum accuracy of 91.77 percentage accuracy using a larger number of clusters(512) however for computational limits and little increase of accuracy I have chosen a cluster value of 256.It achieves an accuracy of 89.07% accuracy on the training data.I have reshaped Muti dimensional array into a single dimension and applied Kmeans on the single dimnsional arrays after normalizing them.

Using a smaller cluster number of 36 clusters I have visualized Cluster centroids.I have shown the actual data as well as the digits predicted by Kmeans algorithm.
